# AI-Micromouse-Maze-editor
A MicroMouse maze editor created by Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental

This was created without any coding adjustments

It allows editing of the maze and saving in standard text format.

It will show the route using the shortest path, a corner-weighted path for a straighter route and left-hand wall flowing

You can also highlight cells with no walls, as these can be difficult to navigate

A random maze generator is also included to give you a head start

The diagonal route solving leaves something to be desired, but I left it in anyway
